Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree 


This is a Project to illustrate Data wrangling skills by using the legendary [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?lang=de)tweets. A lot of the wrangling is about merging the different data sets and cleaning unnecessary data or mistakes.  

In this project, i will be using Tweepy to query Twitter's API for additional data beyond the data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. This additional data will include retweet count and favorite count.


**Gather** each of the three pieces of data as described below in a Jupyter Notebook titled wrangle_act.ipynb:
- one downloaded CSV file (twitter_archive_enhanced.csv)
- one programmatically downloaded csv file with Request library (image_predictions.tsv)
- and using Tweepy (Twitter API) to download a Tweet archive (JSON file into txt)

- After Gathering the files I did the following steps:
    **Assess** (Quality and Tidiness), 
    **Clean** (Define, Code, Test), 
    **Storing**, 
    Analyzing, 
    Visualizing
