This is a Project to illustrate Data wrangling skills

In this project, you'll be using Tweepy to query Twitter's API for additional data beyond the data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. This additional data will include retweet count and favorite count.


Gather each of the three pieces of data as described below in a Jupyter Notebook titled wrangle_act.ipynb:
- one standard CSV file (twitter_archive_enhanced.csv)
- one programmatically downloaded csv file with Request library (image_predictions.tsv)
- and using Tweepy (Twitter API) to download a Tweet archive (JSON file into txt)

- After importing the files I did the following steps:
    **Assess** (Quality and Tidiness), 
    **Clean** (Define, Code, Test), 
    **Storing**, 
    Analyzing, 
    Visualizing
